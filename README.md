# Review Sentiment Analysis

## Description
This project conducts sentiment analysis on reviews using a combination of machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. It applies preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and resampling techniques to enhance accuracy and performance.

The dataset can be found at [Steam Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/steam-reviews), and it requires the GloVe word embeddings file from [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (the 100 dimensional embeddings).
